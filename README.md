# Machine Learning and Computer Vision Laboratory
In this repository, I share my codes for the MLCV Course of SUT EE department. The course's purpose is to get familiar with the implementation of ML and Image-Processing Algorithms using OpenCV and Scikit-Learn.


## Datasets
In this course 2 Datasets is used (CK+ and KTH).
For Lab 1,2,3,4 and 8 "Cohn-Kanade" Dataset is used, that you can download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuvoalok/ck-dataset) 
or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders1mElHo6XM_wXRwjLHbDESA0XkXUUwi7Aj)

For Lab 9 the "KTH Human Action" Dataset was experimented on, which you can download from their websit [here](https://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/actions/).
## Requirement
- `Python==3.10.0`
- `OpenCV==4.6.0.`
- `Scikit-Learn==1.1.3`
